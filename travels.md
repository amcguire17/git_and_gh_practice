## Place I Have Been

One of my favorite places is Austria because I studied abroad there for 4 months. I lived in a small town in the middle of the Alps. It was a beautiful area where I had a lot of personal growth.

I had a fun experience in Brussels where I was walking down the street and heard my name being called. It turned out that someone I grew up with and hadn't seen in 8 years was also in Brussels. It really is a small world!
