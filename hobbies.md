## My Hobbies

Some of my favorite hobbies are hiking, skiing, and drinking beer. Drinking a beer is even more enjoyable on the top of a mountain, at a glacier lake, or after a long day of skiing.

I also like traveling, visiting museums, and going to concerts but those have been harder to do with COVID.
