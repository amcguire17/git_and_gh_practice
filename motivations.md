## Changing Careers

I wanted to change careers because I wanted a new challenge. I had hit a point in my accounting career where I knew that moving further up would not be the best option for me.
I wanted to find a career where I could use my problem solving and attention to detail skills. Coding seemed like a good fit for me and there is a lot of opportunity to grow.
